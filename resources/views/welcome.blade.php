        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>Travel Smart, Travel Safe</h3>
        <p>We understand that leaving home for university is a big step, and for parents in Mpumalanga, watching their children travel to Gauteng brings natural concerns about safety and comfort. <br>
            Unlike crowded shuttles or buses where you're one of many strangers, we offer something different: <span class="font-bold">a maximum of 4 students per vehicle</span>.
            This means more space for your belongings, a quieter journey to rest or study, and most importantly – a safer, more controlled environment.
            Every parent receives live location tracking and journey updates from departure to arrival. You'll know exactly where your child is, when they've safely reached their destination, and have direct contact with us throughout the trip. No more wondering, no more worrying.
            For students, this means no fighting for luggage space, no uncomfortable overcrowding, and the peace of traveling with just a few other university-goers in a private, secure vehicle.</p>

        <h2>For Parents</h2>
        <h3>We Know What Keeps You Up at Night</h3>
        <p>Sending your child to university in Gauteng means trusting them to navigate one of South Africa's busiest provinces. The journey itself shouldn't add to your worries.
            When you choose our service, you're not just booking transport – you're entrusting your child to someone who understands the responsibility. From the moment we collect your child to the second they arrive safely at their residence, you'll have visibility and direct contact with us. Our live tracking means you can follow along, and our regular updates mean you'll never be left wondering.
            We're a father-run service that treats every student with the same care we'd give our own children. That's not a marketing promise – it's simply how we operate.</p>
